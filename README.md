# Part-of-Speech Tagger\

n-gram based part of speech tagger. Each directory encapsulates tools to "train a model" and tag penn-treebank-formatted input. There are also tools to remove tags from a already tagged corpus and build a confusion matrix based on two tagged versions of the same corpus, these tools are inside the Utils directory.

This is my first large-ish haskell project, so a lot of it is terrible to look at. For that i am sorry.

## Compiling and running

For now, you can take a look at the makefile.
